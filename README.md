This script is based on the install script from André Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts)
but goes a bit further. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a Swisscrm code base server because the default Swisscrm port is changed BEFORE the SwissCRM is started.
